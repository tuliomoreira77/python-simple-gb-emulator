# python-simple-gb-emulator

Simple gameboy emulator in python, made just for fun.  

This code does not follow any best practice. **~~DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.~~**  
But at least it's being written using only good old stuff: 
Docs, stack overflow and google. 
No GPT's, no Copilot,  just some old handmade code.  


Docs i'm using mostly:
https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.9.4/gbz80.7  
https://gbdev.io/pandocs/CPU_Instruction_Set.html
