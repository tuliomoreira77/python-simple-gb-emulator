# 🕹️ Python Simple GB Emulator

A simple **Game Boy emulator** written in **pure Python**, made just for fun.  
This project it’s 100% handmade using only **docs**, **Stack Overflow**, and **Google**.  
No Copilot. No GPT (acctually I used to write this readme lol). Just some old-fashioned coding fun.

## ⚙️ About the Project

This emulator aims to replicate the core functionality of the original **Nintendo Game Boy**, including CPU, memory, and graphics rendering.  
It was created for educational purposes and as a technical challenge to better understand how the Game Boy works internally.

## 🚀 How to Run

To achieve a playable performance, this emulator **must** be executed using **PyPy**, the JIT-compiled Python interpreter.  
Running it with standard Python (CPython) will be significantly slower.

### 1. Install PyPy
Download PyPy from:  
👉 [https://pypy.org/](https://pypy.org/)

### 2. Install pygame-ce using PyPy
```bash
pypy -m ensurepip
pypy -m pip install pygame-ce
````

### 3. Set Your ROM Path

Edit the file `gameboy.py` and set the path to your Game Boy ROM file.

Example:

```python
ROM_PATH = "roms/pokemon_red.gb"
```

Make sure the path points to a valid `.gb` ROM file.

### 4. Run the Emulator

Start the emulator from the command line:

```bash
pypy gameboy.py
```

If everything is configured correctly, the emulator window will open and the game will start running.

## 🧠 Fun Fact

This emulator was built **entirely by hand** — without AI tools, Copilot, or code generators.
Just classic documentation, debugging, and determination.
